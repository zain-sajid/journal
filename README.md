## Test Plan: 

1. Testing the app in a real world senario, using test routes to make sure that it enhances the user experience
2. Testing the app and checking its scalability. Make sure that user data is absolutely secure.

## Future Improvements:

1. Redux state management. Normal unidirectional state management is difficult with different APIs
2. Complete the application of IoT with MathWorks API
3. Design Improvements: Improve the overall design
4. Make every post saved on the Blockchain
